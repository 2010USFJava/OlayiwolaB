/*Java is an object oriented language
objects have states and behavior
Class- template for an object
make instances by utilizing classes' constructors
Pillars of OOP
-Polymorphism
	-many forms
	-method overriding and overloading
		-overriding - same name and params, diff behavior (between 2 classes)
		-overloading -same name, but diff params (same class)	
	-Multiple "is-a" relationships
	-Covariance
-Encapsulation
	-wrapping and protecting data fields, preventing outside manipulation
	-concealing the internal state of the object
-Inheritance
	-programming language allows for hierarchy of objects
	- multiple inheritance??- NO! but kinda w/ interfaces
		-Diamond problem 
	
-Abstraction
	-hiding implementation details, exposing only functionality
	-"what it does, not how it does it"
